# Supply Chain Verification System

A comprehensive blockchain-based platform for tracking product journeys from raw materials to consumers, built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts.

## Overview

This system enables transparent tracking of products through their entire supply chain journey while implementing economic incentives for honest reporting and penalties for false information. It promotes truly ethical consumption by providing verifiable product histories.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Product Creation**: Register new products with origin information
- **Stage Tracking**: Add and track multiple stages in a product's journey
- **Verification System**: Stake-based verification mechanism with economic incentives
- **Reputation Management**: Track verifier performance and reliability
- **Ownership Transfer**: Secure transfer of product ownership through the supply chain

### Economic Incentives
- **Staking Mechanism**: Verifiers must stake STX tokens to participate
- **Rewards**: Successful verifications earn STX rewards
- **Penalties**: False reporting results in stake slashing
- **Reputation Scoring**: Dynamic scoring system based on verification history

### Security Features
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions for different operations
- **Economic Security**: Financial incentives align with honest behavior
- **Transparent History**: Immutable record of all product stages
- **Emergency Controls**: Pause functionality for problematic products

## Smart Contract Architecture

### Data Structures

#### Products
- Unique product ID and metadata
- Current stage and ownership information
- Verification status and history
- Creation timestamp and origin details

#### Product Stages
- Stage-specific information (name, location, timestamp)
- Handler and verification details
- Verification count and status

#### Verifier System
- Stake management per product
- Reputation tracking with success/failure rates
- Economic incentive calculations

### Key Functions

#### Public Functions
- `create-product`: Register a new product
- `add-product-stage`: Add a new stage to product journey
- `stake-for-verification`: Stake tokens for verification rights
- `verify-stage`: Verify a specific product stage
- `complete-product-verification`: Mark product as fully verified
- `transfer-product`: Transfer ownership between parties
- `withdraw-stake`: Withdraw staked tokens

#### Administrative Functions
- `set-min-stake`: Configure minimum stake amount
- `set-verification-reward`: Set reward for successful verifications
- `set-false-report-penalty`: Configure penalties for false reports
- `pause-product`: Emergency pause functionality

## Economic Model

### Staking Requirements
- Minimum stake: 1 STX (configurable)
- Stakes are locked during active verifications
- Withdrawal available after verification completion

### Reward Structure
- Successful verification: 0.1 STX reward
- False report penalty: 0.5 STX slash
- Reputation affects future verification opportunities

### Reputation System
- Score calculated as: (successful_verifications / total_verifications) * 100
- Higher reputation enables access to premium verification opportunities
- Reputation affects reward multipliers

## Use Cases

### Supply Chain Participants
1. **Producers**: Register raw materials and initial products
2. **Manufacturers**: Add processing and transformation stages
3. **Distributors**: Track transportation and logistics
4. **Retailers**: Final stage before consumer delivery
5. **Consumers**: Verify product authenticity and ethical sourcing

### Verification Network
1. **Professional Verifiers**: Stake significant amounts for high-value products
2. **Community Verifiers**: Participate in local verification networks
3. **Automated Systems**: IoT integration for real-time verification
4. **Third-party Auditors**: Independent verification services
